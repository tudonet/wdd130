            <h2>Who are Ramon Andrade?</h2>
            <p> I am a software developer with over 5 years of experience in different programming languages, frameworks
                and technologies. <br>In this text, I will share a little about my experience as a developer and the
                development process that I follow to create web and mobile applications.
                <br>The development process consists of several stages that range from the conception of the idea to the
                delivery of the final product. Each step requires a set of specific skills, tools and methodologies.

                <b>Planning and development:</b> In this stage, I define the scope, requirements, functionalities,
                design and architecture of the application. I use tools like diagrams, wireframes, prototypes, and
                documentation to plan and communicate my vision. I also choose the most suitable programming languages,
                frameworks and technologies for the project.
                I follow agile methodologies such as Scrum or Kanban to organize and manage tasks, deadlines and
                deliveries.

                <b>Testing:</b> in this step, I check whether the application works as expected, meets the requirements
                and has no errors or bugs. I use many tools to perform automated tests, which validate the application's
                behavior and logic.

                <b>Production:</b> in this stage, I make the application available to the target audience, whether in a
                web or mobile environment. I use tools like Heroku, AWS or Firebase to host and publish the application
                on the internet. I also use tools like Google Analytics, Mixpanel or Hotjar to monitor and analyze
                application performance, usage and feedback.
