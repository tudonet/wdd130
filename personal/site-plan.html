      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        I am a software developer with over 5 years of experience in different programming languages, frameworks and technologies. In this text, I will share a little about my experience as a developer and the development process that I follow to create web and mobile applications.
        <br><br>
        The development process consists of several stages that range from the conception of the idea to the delivery of the final product. Each step requires a set of specific skills, tools and methodologies.
        <br>
        • Planning and development: in this stage, I define the scope, requirements, functionalities, design and architecture of the application. I use tools like diagrams, wireframes, prototypes, and documentation to plan and communicate my vision. I also choose the most suitable programming languages, frameworks and technologies for the project. I follow agile methodologies such as Scrum or Kanban to organize and manage tasks, deadlines and deliveries.
        <br>
        • Testing: in this step, I check whether the application works as expected, meets the requirements and has no errors or bugs. I use many tools to perform automated tests, which validate the application's behavior and logic. 
        <br>
        • Production: in this stage, I make the application available to the target audience, whether in a web or mobile environment. I use tools like Heroku, AWS or Firebase to host and publish the application on the internet. I also use tools like Google Analytics, Mixpanel or Hotjar to monitor and analyze application performance, usage and feedback.

      <h3>Projects</h3>
      <p>
        I'm a freelance web developer who creates custom websites and applications for my clients. I will talk about some of my completed projects and satisfied clients.
        <br> <br>
        One of my most recent projects was the Fitness Hub website, a chain of gyms that offers various services and modalities to its customers. The Fitness Hub website was created with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and WordPress, and has a modern, responsive and attractive design. The Fitness Hub website allows users to find out about the gym's plans, units, teachers, schedules and news. The Fitness Hub website also has an online login, registration and payment system for customers.
        <br> <br>
        Another project I did was an e-commerce platform that sells a variety of products, such as clothes, shoes, accessories, electronics, etc. The Virtual Store application was developed with React Native, Firebase and Stripe, and offers users an easy, fast and secure shopping experience. The Virtual Store application allows users to browse categories, filter products, view details, add to cart, checkout and track order status. The Virtual Store application also has a rating, recommendation and customer service system.
        <br> <br>
        A third project I carried out was the website for Restaurant Gourmet, a haute cuisine restaurant that serves sophisticated and delicious dishes. The Restaurant Gourmet website was created with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP, and has an elegant, refined and inviting layout. The Restaurant Gourmet website allows users to learn about the restaurant's menu, chef, history, atmosphere and events. The Gourmet Restaurant website also has a reservation, delivery and contact system for customers.
        <br>
        These are some of my completed projects and satisfied clients. I hope you enjoyed getting to know a little about my work as a freelance web developer. If you want to know more about me or my services, you can contact me via email or phone.
