                <p>Another project I did was an e-commerce platform that sells a variety of products, such as clothes, shoes, accessories, electronics, etc. The Virtual Store application was developed with React Native, Firebase and Stripe, and offers users an easy, fast and secure shopping experience. The Virtual Store application allows users to browse categories, filter products, view details, add to cart, checkout and track order status. The Virtual Store application also has a rating, recommendation and customer service system.</p>
