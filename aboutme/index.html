    <h2>Ramon Andrade</h2>
    <p>Hello! Ramon Andrade here, it's great to be in this class with you. I'm very happy to be the father of a girl (4)
        and a boy (1), and I have an incredible wife called JÃ©ssica, I love them so much.</p>
    <p>I'm from Natal - Brazil. I already work as a full stack developer in a company in Madrid - Spain and I also work in my own startup TudoNet. I have to be honest, currently I haven't been doing many things for fun, I've been
        working a lot, taking care of my children, studying and serving in church, I have to improve that =).</p>
    <p>My major is AA in Applied Technology. I love being a web developer, there are many job opportunities.
        It's good to be here and learn from each other. </p>
